Using Go language data structure compressed suffix array (CSA) was implemented.
It has a functionality of a traditional suffix array allowing one to solve
problems of substring lookup. Elias-Fano algorithm was implemented allowing one
to present an index in a succinct representation. Comparative characteristics of
the work for construction and substring lookup for CSA and suffix array were combined
for texts with different contexts.
The dependency between memory consumed by data structures and the size of the initial text
was studied. A comparison between the radix tree and these data structures was performed
by construction time and substring lookup time as well as by memory consumed.

In terms of memory used, CSA showed its efficiency in comparison to suffix array and radix tree,
but the algorithm of index construction and the substring lookup algorithm are less fast
than similar algorithms in a traditional suffix array. Application of the CSA in real data
was considered for applied problems such as substring lookup at a protein sequence and
pattern matching at DNA code used in bioinformatics.
The efficiency of substring search using the radix tree was demonstrated. The complexity
of its application was shown for textual data because of the large data consumption at the tree construction step.

Further studies in this research field can rely on the development of a succinct representation of
existing classical data structures. Application of compression methods such as
considered in this work Elias-Fano algorithm can make it possible to perform
succinct representation of different data types converted to the right format beforehand.
Based on the experiments advantages and disadvantages of studied algorithms and data structures
functioning with real applied problems were identified.
Succinct data structures can be used in algorithms utilizing index storage in outer memory.
This topic is a little-studied one which is why index compression is of interest in
the field of substring indexing in outer memory.
