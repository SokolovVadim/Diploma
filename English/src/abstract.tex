\textbf{Goals and objectives of the work.}

This paper is dedicated to a research on data structures that use succinct index for textual information storage.

The goal of this work is to verify efficiency of different data compression methods.
Application of succinct index in practice is examined to a data of a certain type.
A comparison is made both with traditional solutions (suffix array) and with more recent ones (radix tree)
that use indexing approach different from the data structures under study.

\textbf{The Results Obtained.}

It was possible to obtain comparative performance characteristics of data structures under study.
Were measured and analysed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the volume of memory used;
    \item time used for a substring search;
\end{enumerate}

Compressed data structure - succinct suffix array was implemented in Go programming language.
Memory consumption results for compressed index storaging and speed of substring search are shown in this paper.
