The experiment consists of several main parts.
First of all, study of traditional data structure -- suffix array is carried out
from the perspective of consumed memory, time to build the index and substring search.
Then more modern radix tree is studied, in which similar functioning aspects are covered.
One of the most important part of the work is a development of compressed suffix array (CSA).
At the same time it includes not only testing of CSA with benchmarks similar to other overviewed
data structures but study of the degree of index compression in comparison to suffix array.
It is important to emphasize that a comparison of algorithm on texts with different context
is of particular interest for us.
